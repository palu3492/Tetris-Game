# Tetris
2D Tetris Game written in Python using PyGame

## Deprecated

This project is deprecated. I built an updated version of this game that is easier to read and uses more modern programming concepts. I built the new version for a friend who wanted to teach an AI to play Tetris. The updated version can be found [here](https://github.com/palu3492/tetris-game-updated).

## Run

Run Tetris.py to play with the PyGame package installed (Python 3.6)
